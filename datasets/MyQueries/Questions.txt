In a Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) system, queries typically aim to answer questions related to billing, collections, reimbursements, claims, and financial performance. Here’s a categorized breakdown of key questions stakeholders often ask, which translate into SQL queries or dashboards:

📊 1. Claims & Billing
How many claims were submitted in the past month?

What is the total billed amount vs. total reimbursed amount?

Which claims are still unpaid or pending?

What is the average time to receive payment after claim submission?

What percentage of claims were denied, and why?

How many claims had to be resubmitted or appealed?

💰 2. Payments & Collections
How much was collected in patient payments vs. insurance payments?

What is the total accounts receivable (AR)?

What is the aging of AR (0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 90+ days)?

Which payers are the slowest to pay or most often underpay?

What is the patient responsibility portion vs. insurance?

🏥 3. Patient and Visit-Level Insights
How many patient encounters resulted in a billable claim?

Which procedures or CPT codes generate the most revenue?

What is the average revenue per visit or per procedure?

Which providers have the highest or lowest reimbursement rates?

📈 4. Financial & Operational KPIs
What is the net collection rate?

What is the denial rate over time (trend)?

What’s the average claim value by payer or procedure?

What percentage of revenue is being written off?

🛑 5. Compliance & Audits
Are there duplicate or fraudulent billing patterns?

Which claims were denied due to coding errors or missing documents?

How many appeals were successful?
